Abstract:  
  
• The Waste Management Optimization Using IoT project aims to modernize urban waste collection through smart sensors, AI prediction models, and real time tracking systems. This final phase integrates AI powered bin overflow prediction, efficient route planning, real time data from IoT devices, and encrypted data management. The system is scalable and capable of integration with municipal ERP platforms. This document covers system demonstration, technical documentation, performance metrics, sample code, and future enhancements.
